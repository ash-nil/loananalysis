# loananalysis

Started as a final project in a machine learning course, this is a deep dive into a dataset that presents a variety of loans that have been completed (i.e. charged off or paid in full). The original intention of the analysis was to identify key predictors for a loan to become delinquent, prior to the delinquiency occuring. 

## Release 1
The initial project, to be represented in the first release, is what was originally submitted. It was not an effective model, though. As such, the goal of this repository is to confinue working on the dataset to improve the model's efficacy.
